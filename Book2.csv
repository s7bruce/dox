Good service and nice people to deal with
"I urgently needed a storage unit for some abandoned possessions that I had already booked a removalist for. With only a few hours notice, U-Store were able to understand and help with all the issues including to allow the owner of the possessions the ability to access and claim them within the statutory 42 days required by law before they can be disposed. I had no such success with other more well known high profile storage companies. U-Store stood out like a shining beacon of success and I would happily recommend them to anyone. So far that is!"
